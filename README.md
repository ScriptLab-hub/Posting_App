# Posting App

A simple, single-page blog posting application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project allows users to create posts, add comments, and interact with content in a modern, transparent user interface.

## Features

- **Create Posts:** Easily write and publish new posts. Username and email are optional; you can post as "Anonymous".
- **View Posts:** All posts are displayed in a clean, two-column layout.
- **Add Comments:** Engage with posts by adding comments. You can provide a name or comment anonymously.
- **Delete Posts:** You have the ability to delete any post.
- **Persistent Data:** All posts and comments are automatically saved to the browser's `localStorage`. This means your data will still be there even after you refresh or close the page.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - **Main Post Editor:** Press `Enter` to publish the post. Press `Shift + Enter` to create a new line.
  - **Comment Box:** Press `Enter` to submit your comment.

## How to Run

Since this is a front-end only project, you don't need any special setup.

1.  **Download the Files:** Make sure you have `index.html`, `script.js`, and the `asset` folder in the same directory.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).

That's it! The application will be running locally on your machine.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling, loaded via a CDN for simplicity.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the dynamic functionality, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and interacting with `localStorage`.
